This is a Repo of 3d models used to create a plane for Science Olympiad Event: Flight
Done by Yours Truely Neb

This is not actually a new plane design just a mod of the Freedom Flight Kits that we purchased and where dissapointed by, the proccess was painful expensive and didnt yeild much (i was to blame but to cope i choose to blame the planes). Mylar and Balsa wood should not be paired together. 
So instead of using flimsy balsa we are printing a plane parts that should've been balsa that way they dont break because the direction of the wind changed.

If you foolishly choose to use mylar, feel free as mylar should stick to PLA, however i've elected to use plastic from giant fruits and veggie section as it is more tough, easier to get tought without tearing.

as for the connecting pieces (the freedom flight kits usually use carbon fiber rods) we had some carbon fiber rods from previous planes, if dont have any carbon fiber rods they shouldn't be too expensive just go out and buy some. but if but again if you are unable to get any rods thats a you issue and you can figure out what you can use to substitute for carbon fiber rods.
